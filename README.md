# Contentful App â€“ Manually Trigger Webhook
This is a small Contentful App to add a button to the entry sidebar in Contentful web interface to trigger a webhook manually. Both button text and webhook URL is customisable.

The app can be used for example to manually trigger a deploy. I personally use it to trigger a deploy of my preview environment, since adding a webhook to auto-save triggers deployment too often.
